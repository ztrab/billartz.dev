      Hello! I'm Bill and I'm a full-stack software engineer specializing in front end. I recently worked with
      <a href="https://www.thehutgroup.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-bold underline">THG</a> building a proprietary SSR/Edge SSR platform, called Altitude, focused
      on speed, scalability, analytics and ease of client integration for headless composable ecommerce. Altitude is recently out of beta with a THG owned fashion ecommerce site called
      <a href="https://www.coggles.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary font-bold underline"> Coggles</a>. I previously worked for Target on Dermstore.com which was acquired by THG in 2021.

      When I'm not making the rectangles glow you can find me hiking or snowboarding in Big Bear and Mammoth, going to concerts, tinkering or deep in another
      world in various games on my PC or Steam Deck. I'm currently based in Santa Monica, California.
