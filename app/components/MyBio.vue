      Hello! I'm Bill and I'm a software engineer specializing in front end
      with the occasional proclivity for full-stack. I'm currently employed fulltime with
      <a href="https://www.thehutgroup.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary underline">THG</a> working on a proprietary SSR/ISR platform focused
      on site speed, analytics and ease of client integration for headless ecommerce. The platform has launched in beta with a THG owned fashion ecommerce site called
      <a href="https://beta.www.coggles.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary underline"> Coggles</a>. I previously worked for Target on Dermstore.com which was acquired by THG in 2021.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      When I'm not working with my THG colleagues in the UK making the rectangles glow you can find me hiking or snowboarding in Big Bear and Mammoth, going to concerts, tinkering and/or deep in another
      world in some video game on my PC or Steam Deck. I currently reside in Santa Monica, California.
