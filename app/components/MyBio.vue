      Hello! I'm Bill and I'm a software engineer and technologist. I primarily build in the front end, specializing in Javascript
      with the occasional proclivity for back end work. I'm currently employed fulltime with
      <a href="https://www.thehutgroup.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary underline">THG</a> working on a bespoke SSR/ISR platform focused
      on site speed and ease of client integration for headless ecommerce. The platform has launched in beta with a THG owned fashion ecommerce site called
      <a href="https://beta.www.coggles.com" target="_blank" class="text-primary underline"> Coggles </a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      When I'm not working with my colleagues in the UK making the rectangles glow you can find me hiking, snowboarding in Big Bear or Mammoth, going to concerts or tinkering and/or deep in another
      world in some video game on my PC or Steam Deck. I currently reside in Santa Monica, California.
